1. Created a Project_1 folder under ML_Projects folder
2. Open Anaconda command prompt and go to the Project_1 folder
3. Now write command "code ." to open the folder in VS Code
4. Now create a conda virtual environment. Use this command in VS Code Terminal "conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y"
5. Now activate the environment " conda activate venv/"
6. Now clone the GitHub repository and sync the GitHub and vs code.
	a. Initialize the Git using "git init"
	b. Create README.md file in Project_1 folder.
	c. Now add README.md file to git repository.
	d. Commit the README.md file to git using "git commit -m "First README.md file commit""
	e. Checkout the branch to Main "git branch -M main"
	f. Sync the GitHub repository "git remote add origin https://github.com/sujithreddyk/ML_Projects.git"
	g. To check the sync "git remote -v"
	h. If we are pushing for the first time set git global
		git config --global user.name "sujithreddyk"
		git config --global user.email "ksreddykavali@gmail.com"
	i. Now push the changes to git repo
		git push -u origin Main
	j. Now go to GitHub repo and create a .gitignore file and choose the template as Python
	   This is because some of the files need not be committed to git repo so we create this file.
	k. To make sure everything is up-to-date from our side in VS code use "git pull" command. Now .gitignore
	   file will be visible in vs code as well.
7. Now create Setup.py file which is responsible for creating ML applications as a package and we install and use 
   this package. If we deploy this package in PyPi then anyone can install this package into their code.
8. Now create src folder under Project_1 folder and create _init_.py file inside src. 
9. create requirements.txt file which contains all the dependencies/libraries.
10.we will get an folder automatically once we run "pip install -r requirements.txt" this is because we have linked the requiremnts.txt file with setup.py file with "-e ." in requirements.txt file.
